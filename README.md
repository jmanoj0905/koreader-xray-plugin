## What is X-Ray Plugin?

X-Ray Plugin brings Amazon Kindle's beloved X-Ray feature to KOReader. Using advanced AI technology (Google Gemini or ChatGPT), it automatically extracts and organizes content while ensuring a spoiler-free experience:

    Characters - Names, descriptions, roles, occupations

    Locations - Important places and their significance

    Spoiler Free - Intelligent summaries that avoid revealing major plot twists

    Timeline - Key events in chronological order

    Historical Figures - Real people mentioned in the book

    Themes - Main themes and ideas

    Notes - Your personal character notes

All data is cached locally for offline use and works without internet after the initial fetch!

## Tips & Tricks

### For Best Results

1. **Use original book titles**: "War and Peace" works better than "wp.epub"
2. **Include author name**: Helps AI identify the correct book
3. **Gemini Flash is great**: Free, fast, and accurate for most books
4. **Cache once, use forever**: No need to re-fetch unless you want updates

### Character Search Tips

- Search works with partial names: "john" finds "John Smith"
- Case-insensitive: "JOHN" = "john" = "John"
- First name search: "John" finds "John Smith"

### Historical Figures Detection

The plugin intelligently detects:
- **Direct references**: "Napoleon Bonaparte appears in Chapter 5"
- **Indirect references**: "The 1860s nihilist movement" → Adds key figures
- **Philosophical references**: Characters discussing "Hegel" → Adds Hegel
- **Period atmosphere**: Important figures of the book's era

Examples:
- **"Demons" (Dostoevsky)**: Finds Sergei Nechayev, Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky
- **"War and Peace"**: Finds Napoleon, Kutuzov, Alexander I
- **"1984"**: No historical figures (modern dystopia)
